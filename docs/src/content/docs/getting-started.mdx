description: Learn how to quickly and easily document keyboard shortcuts in your project using the Starlight Kbd plugin.
---

A [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) plugin to quickly and easily document keyboard shortcuts in your project:

- Custom keyboard types, e.g. platform-specific, keyboard layout-specific, etc.
- Global or standalone keyboard type picker to switch between different types of keyboard shortcuts
- Prefered keyboard type persisted across pages
- Improved accessibility for screen readers

Check out the [demo page](/demo/) for a preview of the plugin in action.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import { PackageManagers } from '@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components'
import Preview from '../../components/Preview.astro'
import { Kbd } from 'starlight-kbd/components'

<Steps>

1. Starlight Kbd is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/).
   Install it using your favorite package manager:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-kbd" />

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file by specifying the type of keyboard shortcuts you want to use.

   The following example shows how to configure two types of keyboard shortcuts: macOS and Windows.

   ```js ins={5,10-17}
   // astro.config.mjs
   // @ts-check
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   import starlightKbd from 'starlight-kbd'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
         plugins: [
           starlightKbd({
             types: [
               { id: 'mac', label: 'macOS', default: true },
               { id: 'windows', label: 'Windows' },
             ],
           }),
         ],
         title: 'My Docs',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. Use the provided `<Kbd>` component to document keyboard shortcuts.

   ```mdx title="src/content/docs/index.mdx" ins={7-9}
   ---
   title: My docs
   ---

   Welcome to my project!

   import { Kbd } from 'starlight-kbd/components'

   Use <Kbd mac="Command+S" windows="Control+S" /> to get started.
   ```

4. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to preview the new shortcut and the keyboard type picker added next to the theme picker.

   Using the previous example, the preview should look like this:

   <Preview>

   <Fragment slot="preview">
     Welcome to my project! Use <Kbd mac="Command+S" windows="Control+S" linux="Control+S" /> to get started.
   </Fragment>

   </Preview>

   You can also use the keyboard type picker at the top of this page to switch between the different types of keyboard shortcuts.

</Steps>

Check the [configuration reference](/configuration/) for more information on the available options, the [`<Kbd>` component reference](/components/kbd/) for more information on how to use it, and the [shortcut syntax guide](/guides/shortcut-syntax/) for details on how to write keyboard shortcuts.
