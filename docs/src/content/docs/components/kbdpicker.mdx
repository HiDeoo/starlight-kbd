import { KbdPicker } from 'starlight-kbd/components'

To display a keyboard type picker in a page of your documentation, use the `<KbdPicker>` component.

import Preview from '../../../components/Preview.astro'

<Preview>

<Fragment slot="preview">
  <KbdPicker />
</Fragment>

</Preview>

## Import

```tsx
import { KbdPicker } from 'starlight-kbd/components'
```

## Usage

Use the `<KbdPicker>` component to display a keyboard type picker in a page of your documentation.

Combined with the [`globalPicker`](/configuration/#globalpicker) configuration option, manually rendering the `<KbdPicker>` component can be useful if only one or a few pages of your documentation use keyboard shortcuts.

<Preview>

```mdx
import { KbdPicker } from 'starlight-kbd/components'

```

<Fragment slot="preview">

Use the following picker to switch between different keyboard types:

## `<KbdPicker>` Props

The `<KbdPicker>` component does not accept any props.
